1️⃣ Natural Numbers:
        ✅ 1,2,3,4,5....etc numbers is nothing but natural numbers.
            natural always will be positive numebrs.
            smallest natural number is 1.
            0 (zero) is not a natural number, why because the natural numbers is start from 1 only.
            all numbers are positive only.

2️⃣ Whole Numbers:
        ✅ 0,1,2,3,4,5,....etc numbers are consider as whole numbers.
            both natural and whole numebrs are same but the difference is..  in natural number we starts from 1 and don't have 0, but in whole numbers we starts from zero and we consider zero here.
            smallest whole number is 0.
            all numbers are positive.
3️⃣ Integers:
        ✅ etc ....-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4.... etc  numbers are integers.
            the integers consider all positive and negative numbers.
   🔹Posivtive Integers:
              ✅ 1,2,3,4,5,6....etc numbers are positive integers.
   🔹Negative Integers:
              ✅ -1,-2,-3,-4,-5....etc numbers are negative integers.

******NOTE: Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative.**********

4️⃣ Even Numbers:
        ✅ 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30.....etc 
             The numbers which is divisible by 2, such numbers are know as Even Numbers.
             Simple logic is if a number 1's place having digit 2,4,6,8,0 then that number is know as Even Number.
             Example: 
                 ✅ 144 ----- Even number. Why because in 1's place we have 4 so, it is divisible by 2 means Even Number.
                 ✅ 7883948 ----- Even number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 8 so, it is divisible by 2 means Even Number.
                 ✅ 80039030 ------- Even number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 0 so, it is divisible by 2 means Even Number.

5️⃣ Odd NUmbers: 
         ✅ 1,3,5,7,9,13,15,19,23,25,27,29.....etc
             The numebrs which is not divisible by 2, such numebrs are know as Odd Numbers.
             Simple logic is if the number is having 1,3,5,7,9 in 1's place then such numbers is know as Odd Number.
             Example:
                 ✅ 367 ------ Odd number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 7 so, it is not divisible by 2 because we get reminder as 1 which means it's a Odd Number.
                 ✅ 80436583 ------ Odd number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 3 so, it is not divisible by 2 because we get reminder as 1 which means it's a Odd Number.
                 ✅ 8983979468365 ---- Odd number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 5 so, it is not divisible by 2 because we get reminder as 1 which means it's a Odd Number.

6️⃣ Prime Numbers:
         ✅ 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,23,29.......etc
             The prime numebrs are nothing but a number that exactly has 2 factors 1 and itself is know as Prime Number.
             Here, 2 is both Even Number and Prime Number (2 is even prime number).
             Smallest prime number is 2.

7️⃣ Composit Numbers:
         ✅ 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20.......etc
             The Composit Number is a number which has more than 2 factors.
             Example:
                 ✅ 4 ---> 2*2, 1*4. Here 1,2,4 are factors for number 4.
                 ✅ 24 ---> 1*24, 2*12, 4*6. Here 1,2,4,6,12,24 are factors for number 24.

8️⃣ Co-Prime Numbers:
         ✅ (7,9), (15,16), 
              The Co-Prime Numbers are nothing but two numbers (natural numbers), If their HCF is 1.
        🔹 (12, 5)
              Factors of 12 → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
              Factors of 5 → 1, 5
        👉 Common factor = 1 only
         ✅ HCF = 1 → So (12, 5) are Co-prime numbers ✅

        🔹 (8, 40)
              Factors of 8 → 1, 2, 4, 8
              Factors of 40 → 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40
        👉 Common factors = 1, 2, 4, 8
        ❌ HCF = 8 → So (8, 40) are NOT Co-prime numbers ❌

9️⃣ Rational Numbers:
        ✅ 7/3, 2/5, 5/9 ..... etc 
            Definition: 
                 A number that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0, is called a Rational Number.
        📝 NOTE: The denominator (q) should never be zero.

🔟 Irrational Numbers:
        ✅ Examples: √2, √3, π, 0.1010010001... etc.
              📘 Definition: A number that cannot be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0, is called an Irrational Number.
        📝 NOTE: Irrational numbers have non-terminating, non-repeating decimal expansions.
            They cannot be written as a simple fraction.
1️⃣1️⃣Real Numbers:
        ✅ 7/3, 2/5, √2, √3, 5/9, √5, 5/7, √3 ...etc.
            Cobination of both Rational and Irrational Numbers are know as Real Numbers.
        📝 NOTE:
            Real numbers include integers, fractions, terminating decimals, repeating decimals, and non-repeating/non-terminating decimals.
            Real numbers do not include imaginary or complex numbers.
