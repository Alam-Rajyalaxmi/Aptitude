Natural Numbers:
        1,2,3,4,5....etc numbers is nothing but natural numbers.
        natural always will be positive numebrs.
        smallest natural number is 1.
        0 (zero) is not a natural number, why because the natural numbers is start from 1 only.
        all numbers are positive only.

Whole Numbers:
        0,1,2,3,4,5,....etc numbers are consider as whole numbers.
        both natural and whole numebrs are same but the difference is..  in natural number we starts from 1 and don't have 0, but in whole numbers we starts from zero and we consider zero here.
        smallest whole number is 0.
        all numbers are positive.
Integers:
       etc ....-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4.... etc  numbers are integers.
       the integers consider all positive and negative numbers.
   Posivtive Integers:
            1,2,3,4,5,6....etc numbers are positive integers.
   Negative Integers:
            -1,-2,-3,-4,-5....etc numbers are negative integers.

******NOTE: Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative.**********

Even Numbers:
     0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30.....etc 
     The numbers which is divisible by 2, such numbers are know as Even Numbers.
     simple logic is if a number 1's place having digit 2,4,6,8,0 then that number is know as Even Number.
     Example: 
         144 ----- Even number. Why because in 1's place we have 4 so, it is divisible by 2 means Even Number.
         7883948 ----- Even number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 8 so, it is divisible by 2 means Even Number.
         80039030 ------- Even number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 0 so, it is divisible by 2 means Even Number.

Odd NUmbers: 
      1,3,5,7,9,13,15,19,23,25,27,29.....etc
      The numebrs which is not divisible by 2, such numebrs are know as Odd Numbers.
      Simple logic is if the number is having 1,3,5,7,9 in 1's place then such numbers is know as Odd Number.
      Example:
         367 ------ Odd number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 7 so, it is not divisible by 2 because we get reminder as 1 which means it's a Odd Number.
         80436583 ------ Odd number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 3 so, it is not divisible by 2 because we get reminder as 1 which means it's a Odd Number.
         8983979468365 ---- Odd number. Why beacuse in 1's place we have 5 so, it is not divisible by 2 because we get reminder as 1 which means it's a Odd Number.
